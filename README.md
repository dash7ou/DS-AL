# Data structures & Algorithms

Welcome! In this repo I have solve over 50 questions about data structures and algorithms u can found them in Questions.xlsx, file contains a collection of 51 questions covering various topics related to Data Structures and Algorithms. Whether you are preparing for a coding interview or studying these concepts for personal growth, these questions aim to challenge and expand your understanding of data structures and algorithms.

Each question is accompanied by a brief description that outlines the problem statement. These questions are meant to challenge your problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and understanding of various data structures. By attempting these questions, you can deepen your understanding of how to apply data structures and algorithms to real-world scenarios.
